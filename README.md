# Analytics SDK Android
Welcome to the Analytics SDK Android!

Integration of analytics i.e. Mixpanel, Google Analytics etc. is important for any application. There are the common problems developers face while integrating analytics, few of them are:
- Replace one analytics from another i.e. if you previously has Google Analytics but now want to integrate Mixpanel, you have to write a lot of code again and remove old code which is time confusing and error prone.
- Implementing more than one analytics. New integration might take time again and some events may be missing.

To overcome these problems, we have created an SDK which provides facilities to overcome above scenarios easily.

Read our developer documents to integrate this SDK.
